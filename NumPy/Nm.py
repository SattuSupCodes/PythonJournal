''' Numpy is a python library which comes in great use when dealing with advanced
array and matrix operations. 

NumPy is the reason python is now being used in scientific computing applications.

NumPy implements multi-dimensional, homogeneous, and matrix types that hold not only numbers
but also user-defined records, and provides efficient element-wise operations.

SciPy is a liberary written on top of NumPy, providing many scientific computing
algorithms from linear algebra, numerical calculusm and statistics. '''

# example
import NumPy as np
a = np.arange(12)
print(a)
